# Cinema

## Overview

The project models a multiplex cinema, complete with a ticket office. In this ticket office, screens can be added, individuals can buy tickets from the movie, the screens can show different movies, and more!

My continued learning of these important programming principles is demonstrated through this project:

- JUnit
- Test-driven development
