# Cinema

## Overview

The project models a multiplex cinema, complete with a ticket office. In this ticket office, screens can be added, individuals can buy tickets from the movie, the screens can show different movies, and more!

My continued learning of important programming principles including:

- JUnits
- Test-driven development
- Documentation

is demonstrated through this project.
